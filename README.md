============================================

A Sublime Text 2 Google Closure Build System for Windows users.

PREREQUISITES
------------------------------------

Java JRE must be installed on your Windows system and Google Closure *.jar (downloadable here - http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/downloads/detail?name=compiler-latest.zip) must be on your Sublime Text installation, in "\Data\Packages\User\Google Closure\".

INSTALLATION
------------------------------------

1. Download the zipped package from Github;
2. Browse to the Sublime Text 2 Package folder:
        C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages

3. Once opened, close Sublime Text 2;
4. Extract the *.zip, rename the folder to "Google Closure Build" (or something like this) and move it in the package folder;

Now you will find the Sass build system in "Tools" -> "Build Systems..." -> "Google Closure".
Enjoy!
